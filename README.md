### Sales Pipeline Analysis

This project involves predicting close values in a sales pipeline dataset using linear regression. The Python script (`app.py`) loads the dataset, selects relevant features and a target variable, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a linear regression model, makes predictions, evaluates the model's performance, and visualizes the actual vs predicted close values.

### Files Included:

- `app.py`: Python script for predicting close values in a sales pipeline dataset.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file listing the required Python packages.

### Prerequisites:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage:

1. **Running the Application**:
   - Update the file path in `app.py` to point to your dataset (`sales-pipeline.xlsx`).
   - Run `app.py` to execute the sales pipeline analysis.

### Requirements:

- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Note:
Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and load the sales pipeline dataset (`sales-pipeline.xlsx`).
